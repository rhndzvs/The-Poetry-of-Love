A Shadowless Beauty

You have no shadow,
For nothing in this world
Can replicate
The beauty you possess.

In a world full of noise,
You stand still, untouched,
A quiet force,
Too pure to be rushed.

Your light is soft,
It warms the coldest nights.
It is something real,
That feels just right.

It is like a flame,
That never fades,
A quiet glow,
That always stays.

Your essence shines bright,
No shadow can keep pace,
A beauty so pure,
It leaves only grace.

Her laughter is light,
A breeze through the air,
It lingers softly,
Beyond compare.

Her presence is rare,
Like the moon's gentle glow,
A beauty that grows,
A love I all know.
